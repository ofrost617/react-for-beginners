Everything in React is called a component.

A component is a reusable piece of a website. React allows you to create your own components/tags

Anywhere that state is changed in a React component, it changes/updates everywhere that data appears on the page.

static/js/bundle.js when server is started and page loads is a link to a react file. Any code written in react.js will be bundled into bundle.js

Every react component needs at least 1 method- the render() method.

When we want our react component to show, we go into out index.html and into the mounting component- here it's the div id-main.
We have to import reactDOM in index.js in order to be able to render our component.

Best practice to put each component in separate files.
